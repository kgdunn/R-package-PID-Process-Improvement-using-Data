## CRAN Resubmission - pid version 0.51

This is a resubmission addressing feedback from the CRAN maintainers.

### Changes made:

Fixed the NOTE regarding "height/width attributes should be in pixels" in the Rd files check:

- File: man/tradeOffTable.Rd, line 28
- Changed: width="100%" to style="width: 100%;"
- Reason: HTML5 standard requires height/width attributes to be in pixels. For percentages or other units, CSS style attributes must be used instead.

The package now complies with the HTML5 standard for figure attributes in documentation files.

### Testing:

Please run `R CMD check --as-cran pid_0.51.tar.gz` to verify that the NOTE has been resolved.

Thank you for your time reviewing this package.

Best regards,
Kevin Dunn
